## [Earthquake Damage Prediction](Earthquake Prediction/Final Project Report - Alp Serdaroglu.pdf)

The aim of this project is to predict the earthquake damage during 2015 Nepal Earthquakes. The dataset is prepared by the Government of Nepal and includes building data from Kathmandu. Several different approaches are compared in the project to determine the best method to predict when there is an ordered relationship between the classes of the target variable. This project was prepared as part of the ISYE 6740 Computational Data Analysis course which I took in the Fall 2023 semester at Georgia Tech.

## [Application of Black - Litterman Portfolio Optimization Model to Istanbul Stock Exchange (BIST 30)](Portfolio Optimization/MVO.html)

This is a self-project to apply the Black - Litterman Portfolio Selection Model Istanbul Stock Exchange, specifically BIST 30 index which contains 30 stocks with the highest market capitalizations. I applied and compared the Mean-Variance Optimization model and its Black-Litterman extension. This work is inspired by the senior design project that I completed in Spring 2021 with my friends at Bogazici University.

## [Estimating the Bias in the Election Polls for 2023 Turkish General Election](Election Poll Bias Estimation/ISYE 6416 Project - Final Report - Alp Serdaroglu.pdf)

The aim of the project is to estimate the bias in the election polls conducted for the 2023 Turkish General Elections. Several different methods are considered to understand the nature of the bias. Depending on the methods used, we will try the estimate the value or the direction (positive or negative) of the bias towards a certain political party from a certain polling company. This project was prepared as part of the ISYE 6416 Computational Statistics course which I took in the Spring 2023 semester at Georgia Tech.
